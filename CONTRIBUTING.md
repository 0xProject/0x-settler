# Exhaustiveness

This document is not a complete description of the requirements for contributing
to this repository. Just because this document doesn't say that you can't do
something, doesn't mean that we won't be mad at you if you're a jerk or waste
our time. This document deliberately does not explain the formatting/style,
testing, prerequisites, or performance profiling that is required for a
successful pull request. If you can't figure those steps out from the
[README.md](README.md), the [GitHub CI](.github/workflows/), pre-commit hooks,
or general use of [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), don't contribute to this
repository.
