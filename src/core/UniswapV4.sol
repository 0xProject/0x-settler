    //// These two functions are the entrypoints to this set of actions. Because UniV4 has a
    //// mandatory callback, and the vast majority of the business logic has to be executed inside
    //// the callback, they're pretty minimal. Both end up inside the last function in this file
    //// `unlockCallback`, which is where most of the business logic lives. Primarily, these
    //// functions are concerned with correctly encoding the argument to
    //// `POOL_MANAGER.unlock(...)`. Pay special attention to the `payer` field, which is what
    //// signals to the callback whether we should be spending a coupon.

    //// How to generate `fills` for UniV4:
    ////
    //// Linearize your DAG of fills by doing a topological sort on the tokens involved. In the
    //// topological sort of tokens, when there is a choice of the next token, break ties by
    //// preferring a token if it is the lexicographically largest token that is bought among fills
    //// with sell token equal to the previous token in the topological sort. Then sort the fills
    //// belonging to each sell token by their buy token. This technique isn't *quite* optimal, but
    //// it's pretty close. The buy token of the final fill is special-cased. It is the token that
    //// will be transferred to `recipient` and have its slippage checked against `amountOutMin`. In
    //// the event that you are encoding a series of fills with more than one output token, ensure
    //// that at least one of the global buy token's fills is positioned appropriately.
    ////
    //// Now that you have a list of fills, encode each fill as follows.
    //// First encode the `bps` for the fill as 2 bytes. Remember that this `bps` is relative to the
    //// running balance at the moment that the fill is settled.
    //// Second, encode the packing key for that fill as 1 byte. The packing key byte depends on the
    //// tokens involved in the previous fill. The packing key for the first fill must be 1;
    //// i.e. encode only the buy token for the first fill.
    ////   0 -> sell and buy tokens remain unchanged from the previous fill (pure multiplex)
    ////   1 -> sell token remains unchanged from the previous fill, buy token is encoded (diamond multiplex)
    ////   2 -> sell token becomes the buy token from the previous fill, new buy token is encoded (multihop)
    ////   3 -> both sell and buy token are encoded
    //// Obviously, after encoding the packing key, you encode 0, 1, or 2 tokens (each as 20 bytes),
    //// as appropriate.
    //// The remaining fields of the fill are mandatory.
    //// Third, encode the pool fee as 3 bytes, and the pool tick spacing as 3 bytes.
    //// Fourth, encode the hook address as 20 bytes.
    //// Fifth, encode the hook data for the fill. Encode the length of the hook data as 3 bytes,
    //// then append the hook data itself.
    ////
    //// Repeat the process for each fill and concatenate the results without padding.
